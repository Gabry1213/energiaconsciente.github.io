# wordsearch

This application allow's one to play a word search (or word find) game in a browser! It was a summer project to teach myself the fundamentals of web development languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with a heavy usage of jQuery to handle mouse events (mostly)!

## Setting up

First things first! [Click here](https://rawgit.com/nooraftab/wordsearch/master/wordsearch.html) to open the game in your browser!

## Playing

Now look at that hunk of letters! Scroll down and you'll see a handy little table full of words - your task is to find all of them! Put on your eagle eyes and start scanning the grid. 

When you see something that looks like it might be a word (or if you just feel like it - I can't tell you how to live your life), left-click and drag to select the letters you want in the particular direction you'd like (the directions are highlighted so you can see it easy!).

Let go of the mouse whenever you're ready and if you're in luck, the selected letters will outline themselves to show they've been found.

Keep going! You can always refer to the table at the bottom to see what you have left to find - found words will change color & have a strikethrough.

### Buttons!

**New Game** refreshes the game and give you another randomly generated theme of words to find! You can click it at any point in the game.

**Release the sacred answers** does the dirty work for you by finding all the words you haven't found for you! 

### Important Notes: 

- 'Backspace' functionality (going backwards to deselect a letter) is supported!
- Letters can overlap.
- Words can appear vertically, horizontally, or diagonally - backwards too!
- This is a completely mouse-based game.

2) bunkat's [wordfind game](https://github.com/bunkat/wordfind) was a great resource in helping me get started - while i didn't implement things quite the same way they did, it was a helpful resource nonetheless for figuring out bits and pieces! 

3) [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) helped me catch on to the basics of HTML/CSS and JavaScript/JQuery and was an all-around very helpful reference!
